# owasp-threat-dragon-models
example threat models for the OWASP Threat Dragon project

* Example Web App threat model is a model implemented in different versions using TD, MS-TMT and cisco TB
* Simplest web application is the most minimal model of all, used to test out editing features
* The multi page threat model is used to test that multiple pages can be accessed properly

The other threat models for comparison are Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool, cisco Threat Builder

Two presentations associated with these threat models:
* OWASP_introduction_threat_modeling.odp (about an hour long)
* OWASP_short_introduction_threat_modeling.odp (about 30 minutes or less)
